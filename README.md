## Squirrel Count ##
#### These lines of code in main.py represent my first encounter with pandas and csv libraries.   

--> I learned ways to open csv files with and without pandas, to read only particulars rows or columns from them, based on certain conditions and to create a DataFrame from scratch.   
--> As a challenge, I had to read from a very long and detailed report (csv format) about all the squirrels in the central park and save in another csv file the number of squirrels sorted by their primary fur colour.
